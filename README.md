## For adding new features to the repo (Workflow for version control):

1) ```git checkout -b "feature/the_feature_you_are_working_on"```
Will create a new branch and switch over to it. 

2) Complete whatever you are working on with git add and commit. 
```git add .``` Prepares your changes for a commit.
```git commit -m "your commit message"``` actually makes the commit (only locally at this point).

3) ```git push``` Will push your changes to the same branch you created on the remote repository. NOTE: will have to set --upstream at this point. See your terminals info.

4) Once you are happy with your changes and want to introduce them to the master branch. Create a pull request (on github). Fix any merge conflicts (or get help).

5) Someone, will review and approve and then successfully merge into master. Make sure to delete old branches that have been merged.

## Further info on version control (how and why we are doing it like this):
I have set up according to this methodology so it is most similar to a workplace team environment: https://dev.to/profydev/professional-git-workflow-github-setup-for-react-developers-pfj
